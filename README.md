# Waste-Segregation
Waste Segregation using Advanced Technique. Final year major project
The waste segregation project aims to automate the process of waste classification and disposal using machine learning techniques. The system consists of various components, including a waste analyzing compartment, a camera, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, servo motors, and bins for recyclable and organic waste. When a waste object is placed in the compartment, its image is captured by the camera and processed by the CNN model. The model, trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, classifies the waste into recyclable or organic categories. Based on the classification, the servo motor rotates a pipe-like structure to direct the waste into the appropriate bin. The system operates sequentially, ensuring efficient and accurate waste segregation.

The future scope of the project includes expanding the system to handle more waste categories, integrating sensors for improved waste object detection, and incorporating feedback mechanisms for better control. Furthermore, advancements in machine learning and IoT technologies can be leveraged for real-time monitoring and analysis, optimizing waste management processes and contributing to sustainable waste disposal practices.
